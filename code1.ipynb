            "  Good afternoon, ma'am. I am from Tendikat. I noticed your recent purchase to our wireless earbuds. How are they working for you? Oh yeah, they are really good. The sound quality is great. And the battery has last much longer than I expected. That's wonderful to hear. What they are easy to connect with your phone? Yes, very easy. They paid instantly and I have been using them daily during my works. Excellent. We are glad you are happy with them. Would you mind sharing your experience in a quick product review on our site? It really helps other shoppers. Of course I can do that. I was planning to write one at any way. That's great. As a small thank you, we will send you a 10% discount coupon for your next order once your review is posted. That's nice. I'll post it today itself. Also, just so you know, we have launched a new version of these earbuds with noise cancellation and voice assistance. Since you like this pair, I think you will love that upgrade as well. Oh, that sounds interesting. I'll check it out. Wonderful. I will send you a link with you 50% delivered offer for your loyal customers. Wow, thank you so much. You are most welcome, ma'am. Have a lovely day and happy shopping with a trendy cut.\n"
